# LearningDutch

Vocabulary learning on apps like duolingo is highly inefficient and impractical for beginners, yet usage by beginners persists. Equally, there are no good applications for Dutch verbs that compare to those for conjugations of for example, Spanish. On apps like Anki and Quizlet, there are no flashcard lists that organise dutch verbs by their frequency of usage (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/Dutch_wordlist). 

This is an ongoing project, initially to create CSVs to be used with a 3rd party flashcard application (Quizlet), and eventually to develop a tailor made set of applications for learning Dutch that cater to the needs of those wanting to rapidly acquire Dutch (or any other language)

The scripts output a CSV that displays in Quizlet as in the images below. For each Dutch word, on the reverse of the Flashacrd is given:
1. a translation
2. alternative parses for the part-of-speech and their (up to 3) respective translations
3. an example of the sentence

The sentences are generated by ChatGPT and by ReversoContext's API. The eventual aim is to only generate sentences that use words that have been learned so far.
